plaintext
=========

> minimal cli tool for making plain text files accessible online

what does it do?
----------------

currently it just copies all *.txt files to *.html files

but html isn't plain text!
--------------------------

I know... but how else are you going to get links?

how do I use it?
----------------

  ./plaintext
